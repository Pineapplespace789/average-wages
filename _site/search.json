    "text": "Summary\nThe “Wages by Education” dataset provides a detailed examination of the average hourly wages of workers in the USA, segmented by their highest level of education attained. Spanning from 1973 to 2022, this dataset is sourced from the Economic Policy Institute’s State of Working America Data Library.\nKey research areas and insights include exploring the wage gap based on education levels and identifying trends over time. Analysts can delve into the impact of education on wages across different demographic groups, such as gender and race/ethnicity, and investigate changes in wage inequality between education groups over the decades. The dataset allows for the examination of the relationship between wages and economic indicators like inflation and GDP. Additionally, it enables comparisons of wage trends in various sectors or industries based on education levels and visualizes the wage premiums associated with advanced degrees and their changes over time. The dataset also facilitates exploration of how educational attainment affects wage disparity.\n\n\nGraph"

This may be because of the religious ties to gospel music, which generally connects people and helps them mentally.\nLike every bayesian regression model, this model is not completely accurate in that it was only sent out on a couple social media platforms (Reddit, Discord, other social media), which doesn’t include data from people not involved online, and was advertised on posters and business cards (which restrict the data to a certain proximity)."
